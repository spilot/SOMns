SOMns - A Simple Newspeak Implementation
========================================

Introduction
------------

Newspeak is a dynamic, class-based, object-oriented language in the
tradition of Smalltalk and Self. SOMns is an implementation of the [Newspeak
Specification Version 0.0.95][spec] derived from the [SOM][SOM] (Simple Object
Machine) class libraries, and based on [TruffleSOM][TSOM]. It is
implemented using the [Truffle framework][T] and runs on the JVM platform.

Truffle provides just-in-time compilation based on the Graal compiler,
which enables SOMns to reach [performance that is on par][AWFY] with
state-of-the-art VMs for dynamic languages, including V8.

A simple Hello World program looks like:

```Smalltalk
class Hello usingPlatform: platform = (
  public main: platform args: args = (
    'Hello World!' println.
    ^ 0
  )
)
```

Obtaining and Running SOMns
---------------------------

The basic requirements for SOMns are a system with Java 9 or later, git, ant,
and Python. Windows is currently not supported, but we test on Linux and macOS.

To checkout the code:

    git clone https://github.com/smarr/SOMns.git

Then, SOMns can be build with Ant:

    ant compile

Afterwards, the simple Hello World program is executed with:

    ./som core-lib/Hello.ns

To get an impression of the benefit o

For testing on the command line, the full command is
`./som core-lib/Benchmarks/Harness.ns Mandelbrot 500 0 500`

Additionally, there are JUnit tests and `ant test` for executing the test suite.


A more comprehensive setup guide is available in the `docs` folder and on
[ReadTheDocs][RTD].


Implementation and Deviations from the Specification
----------------------------------------------------

Compared to other Newspeaks and Smalltalks, it is completely file-based
and does not have support for images.
Instead of using customary bytecodes, SOMns is implemented as
[self-optimizing AST interpreter][SOAI] using the Truffle framework.

The overall goal is to be compliant with the specification, but include only
absolutely necessary features. The current list of intended deviations from
the specifications are as follows:

 - the mixin support of slots is not yet complete, see deactivate tests in core-lib/TestSuite/MixinTests.ns

 - simultaneous slots clauses are not fully supported (spec. 6.3.2)

 - object literals currently require a keyword prefix `objL`, to work around
   parser limitations

Setup Development Environment with Eclipse and VS Code
------------------------------------------------------

SOMns code is best written using our VS Code plugin, which provides support
for typical IDE features such as code navigation and compilation, as well as
a debugger. The [SOMns][vscode] support can then be installed via the Marketplace.

For the development of SOMns itself, we typically use Eclipse.
A complete guide on how to setup a workspace is available in the `docs` folder
and on [ReadTheDocs][RTD].


Development Status
------------------

Active development of SOMns happens on the `dev` branch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smarr/SOMns.png?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/smarr/SOMns/tree/dev).

The latest release is reflected by the `release` branch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smarr/SOMns.png?branch=release)](https://travis-ci.org/smarr/SOMns).

Changes and releases are documented in our [CHANGELOG.md][cl].
