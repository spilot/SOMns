SOMns - A Simple Newspeak Implementation
========================================

Introduction
------------

Newspeak is a dynamic, class-based, purely object-oriented language in the
tradition of Smalltalk and Self. SOMns is an implementation of the [Newspeak
Specification Version 0.0.95][spec] derived from the [SOM][SOM](Simple Object
Machine) class libraries, and based on the [TruffleSOM][TSOM]. Thus, SOMns is
implemented using the [Truffle framework][T] and runs on the JVM platform.

A simple Hello World program looks like:

```Smalltalk
class Hello usingPlatform: platform = (
  public main: platform args: args = (
    'Hello World!' println.
    ^ 0
  )
)
```

Implementation and Deviations from the Specification
----------------------------------------------------

SOMns is implemented as [self-optimizing AST interpreter][SOAI] using the
Truffle framework. Thus, it can utilize the Truffle support for just-in-time
compilation to optimize the execution performance at runtime. It is completely
file-based and does not have support for images. The parser is written in Java
and creates a custom AST that is geared towards representing the executable
semantics.

The overall goal is to be compliant with the specification, but include only
absolutely necessary features. The current list of intended deviations from
the specifications are as follows:

 - the mixin support of slots is not yet complete, see deactivate tests in core-lib/TestSuite/MixinTests.ns

 - simultaneous slots clauses are not fully supported (spec. 6.3.2)

 - object literals currently require a keyword prefix `objL`, to work around
   parser limitations

Obtaining and Running SOMns
---------------------------

This is a brief guide, a more comprehensive overview for users or developers is
available in the `docs` folder and on [ReadTheDocs](http://somns.readthedocs.io/en/dev/).

To checkout the code:

    git clone https://github.com/smarr/SOMns.git

Then, SOMns can be build with Ant:

    ant compile

Afterwards, the simple Hello World program is executed with:

    ./som core-lib/Hello.ns

Setup Development Environment with Eclipse and VS Code
------------------------------------------------------

1. Install JDK 1.8 and Eclipse Mars (or later)

2. Download the project from Github
   `git clone https://github.com/smarr/SOMns.git`

3. Run `ant compile` on the command line, or via Eclipse, to make sure that all
   libraries are loaded and available.

4. Create Truffle Eclipse projects with `ant ideinit`.

5. Import SOMns project and the Truffle projects into Eclipse

6. For debugging the interpreter, create a run configuration with the
   Mandelbrot benchmark.
   In option Run Configurations go to Java Application/SOMns and select tab
   arguments, enter:

   In Program arguments:
     `core-lib/Benchmarks/Harness.ns Mandelbrot 2 0 500`

   In VM arguments:
     `-ea -esa`

For testing on the command line, the full command is
`./som -G core-lib/Benchmarks/Harness.ns Mandelbrot 2 0 500`

Additionally, there are JUnit tests and `ant test` for executing the test suite.

To use VS Code as IDE and debugger for SOMns programs,
it needs to be installed manually from: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

The [SOMns](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MetaConcProject.SOMns) support can then be installed via the Marketplace.
